spotify-roulette
================

A button that opens a completely random spotify track.


The code is a little messy but it's short and sweet. 
[Spotify Roulette](http:/dream.ai)


First you run slurp.js to connect the urbandictionary.com/random.php result to the search function of spotify.
the results are then streamed to redis for your listening pleasure.
